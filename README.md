# learninjs

Ok so i started this project to learn js... why js?? dunno i guess i like web development and you can use it for lots of stuff.

As my first Project i built a calculator and right now am advancing with things nobody will prolly ever need.
I added firebase since i saw a friend who uses js a fucklot using it before and thought its kinda interesting.
my code is a mess ngl but it somehow works i guess.
btw from now on this calc is called calc2gether 

sry if the variables are kinda ass im just that stupid :/

also that empty calculator folder??? idk how to remove that am new to github


STUFF IT CAN DO:
-add/div/mul/sub 2 numbers
-give you a roomcode after you have entered smth
-uses roomcode to identify you when you reenter the site(cookie based)
-put roomcode into inputfield to join a different room


STUFF IM WORKING ON
-clear function,partly works  (if you put clear into the input field it will clear the results)
-message board (just enter messages in input box and they will appear on your friends screen)
-calculating with () and multiple values (mayb sometime idk)
-fix some weird stuff like the result going out the input box
